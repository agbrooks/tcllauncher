ChangeLog

version 1.6 / 17-Aug-2015

	* tcllauncher::demonize when invoked with the -noclose option will still
	  redirect any stdio files (stdin, stdout, stderr) to/from /dev/null if
	  the corresponding stdio handle does not exist.

	* clean and distclean make targets fixed/improved

	* configure script now included in distribution

	* remove all reference to Windows

version 1.5 / 3-Oct-2014

	* tcllauncher no longer generates or references a shared library.

	* tcllauncher now is linked against the thread library to avoid
	  deadlocking if Tcl is built with threads

	* Sync Makefile.in with TEA 3.9; clean up the generation of the object
	  file and the executable

	* tcllauncher-support.tcl is now macro-substituted from
	  tcllauncher-support.tcl.in to get package and version right every time

version 1.4 / 2-Sep-2014

	* reassert lock on pidfile during pidfile_write

		The documented usage of pidfile_open and pidfile_write did not actually work
		because the flock on the pidfile would not survive the daemonize call to fork
		to a background process.  Now we re-assert the lock on the pidfile when calling
		pidfile_write (aborting if the lock cannot be obtained) so that the pidfile can
		be reliably used as a lockfile as documented.

	* Updated build instructions for Debian.

	* Corrected unclear pidfile_open documentation.

	* manual page rendering improvements.

	* Update README and license and remove superfluous stuff from launcher.h

	* Support for Tcl 8.6

	* In pid_open properly handle the case of specifying the path to the pid
	  file.  Also properly support the file mode argument.

version 1.3 / 26-Nov-2012

	* Catch the sourcing of the app's main.tcl file and if there is an error,
	  customize the error message to include that it's a tcllauncher app and
	  the command line arguments, then write it to stderr and exit with a
	  nonzero exit status.

	* Change the name of the startup routine to the more standard "main".

version 1.2 / 18-Jan-2011

	* Upgrade to Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) 3.8.

	* Add aclocal.m4 to create a rule for finding the path to dtplite and modify
	  configure.in to use that rule.

	* Merge daemonize.tcl and pidfile.tcl into tcllauncher.tcl

	* Reference Tcl 8.5 in docs and whatnot.

	* Add support for Mac OS X

version 1.1 / 11-Jun-2009

	* Alter Makefile.in to have rules for building the tcllauncher.n
	  manpage using dtplite based on the tcllauncher.man Tcl doctools file.

	* Deploy pidfile_* and daemonize functions.

	* Document pidfile functions.

	* Builds cleanly on Debian.  Added README.Debin with configure instructions.

	* Upgrade to Tcl Extension Architecture (TEA) 3.7

version 1.0 / 18-Mar-2008

	* Create a global variable, launchdir, containing the directory that
	  the main.tcl is being run out of, if the path to the executable
	  is .../bin/programName, else set that variable to "."  This provides
	  a way for programs to find other files they installed alongside
	  their main.tcl.

	* When invoked as a shell, [info nameofexecutable] returns nothing.
	  Detect that condition and, if so, use the SHELL environment variable to
	  form the basis of what we do.  For instance, if the shell is /usr/local/bin/farsh,
	  we'll run /usr/local/lib/farsh/main.tcl.

	* Make sure tcllauncher gets installed into the bin directory.

	* When allocating memory to fiddle command line arguments before
	  invoking Tcl_Main, use malloc instead of ckalloc because whatever
	  ckalloc needs hasn't necessarily been initialized yet.

	* Using $(COMPILE) instead of $(CC) for compiling the main routine
	  makes it work on FreeBSD as well as the Mac.
